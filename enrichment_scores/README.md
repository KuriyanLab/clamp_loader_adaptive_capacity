This folder has the enrichment scores from the deep mutational scan of the RR2/T4 chimeric clamp loader.
There are 3 worksheets in the spreadsheet:
1: DMS of the T4 clasp subunit in the context of the RR2/T4 chimeric clamp loader.
2: DMS of the t4 sliding clamp in the context of the RR2/T4 chimeric clamp loader.
3: DMS of the AAA+ module from RR2 phage in the context of the RR2/T4 chimeric clamp loader.
