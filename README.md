# clamp_loader_adaptive_capacity
This repo has the scripts and data that were used in our manuscript on the Adaptive capacity of a DNA polymerase clamp-loader ATPase complex (https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msae013/7595589)

The contents of the folders are:
AAA+_swaps: raw counts and enrichment analysis of the chimeric clamp loader variants tested in this study.
enrichment_scores : enrichment scores calculated relative to the RR2/T4 chimeric clamp loader, from the deep mutational scan of the clamp, clasp subunit and the AAA+ module.
kallisto_files: the fasta files to generate the kallisto index files that were used to obtain the raw counts of the mutant variants of the RR2/T4 chimeric clamp loader.
